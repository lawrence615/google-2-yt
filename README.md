This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## New things learnt
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - will be used for styling instead of of Materual UI. It uses mobile first design principles.
  - creating custom class name inside global.css file
  - use of Tailwind CSS plugin, [@tailwindcss/line-clamp](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/multi-line-truncation-with-tailwindcss-line-clamp), for truncating text to a specific number of lines.
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) - instead of Material Icons, this is what we shall be using. They work natively with Tailwind.
- SSR React
- `Image from "next/image"` - and setting of fetch permissions in the `next.config.js`
